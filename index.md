## Data-Centric AI: Data Quality Management for Improved Fairness, Robustness, and Accuracy in Predictive Modeling, A07 (Babak Salimi)

1. The most interesting topic I covered so far was the utlization of ZORRO and it's ability to measure and maintain a dataset's robustness quite well

2. A personal investigation is that I want to utilize a more efficient manner of error injection "attack" that would actively showcase and "fight" ZORRO's ability to keep a strong robustness measure on a given dataset.

3. My methods still feel too basic, I want some more time to research a more advanced error injection function to challenge ZORRO than just "leave one out" approach but I also want to look into an avenue of fixing this advanced error injection if robustness measures turn up poor. Effectively, I have a strong basis idea but a lower clear vision of direction.

4. As per mentioned, I want to look into more functions like "leave one out". Specifically I want to look into functions that find the important row values towards training a model. I also want to see what exactly these row values fall under. (for example, perhaps gender is correlationed to high model performance)
